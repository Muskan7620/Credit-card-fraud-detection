PROJECT 1:CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION 
# 🔍 Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

A Python-based project that identifies fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models, with a focus on data exploration, anomaly detection, and model evaluation.

## 📌 Project Objective

To simulate a real-world fraud detection pipeline that can help financial institutions like Wells Fargo prevent unauthorized transactions using predictive analytics.

## 🧠 What This Project Does

- Preprocessed highly imbalanced credit card transaction data (anonymized)
- Visualized fraud patterns using seaborn, matplotlib, and pandas
- Applied machine learning models:
  - **Logistic Regression**
  - **Random Forest Classifier**
  - **Isolation Forest** (unsupervised anomaly detection)
- Evaluated model performance using:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - ROC-AUC score
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.9**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** for data handling
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** for visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for modeling
- **Google Colab** as the development environment

## 📊 Dataset

- [Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- Contains anonymized features (`V1` to `V28`)
